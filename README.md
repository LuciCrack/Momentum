Welcome to Momentum!

A game prototype made using Rust and the Bevy Engine.

The core idea of this game is to make movement feel fast and fluid.
Enjoying the speed and momentum is the main goal of this prototype.

Unfortunetly I couldn't finish the game idea in time ):
But you can move and dash around :)

🎮 How to Play

W A S D – Move

Space – Jump (Works in walls too)

Left Shift – Dash

Esc – Pause

How to run game

This should work on linux, windows and mac, but I wasn't able to test on windows and mac.
You should be able to play by running the executable "Momentum"
or you can run it using Rust and Cargo:
* You must have Rust nightly with Cargo installed (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html)
* Download the source code from GitHub (https://github.com/LuciCrack/Momentum)
* Run using "cargo run"

Contact Me if you need help running or just want to talk to me: "lupici" in discord

🙋‍♀️ About Me (Skip if you don't care lol)

Hi! I’m Lupici (she/her), just your average high schooler with an interest in computer science — especially game development.
I’m still learning, so please don’t expect anything super polished.
This is my first game jam entry, and I’m just having fun and learning along the way!

Any suggestions and comments are super appreciated.
I hope you enjoy this game!!
